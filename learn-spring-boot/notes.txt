Get Production Ready with Spring Boot
    - There are different types of environments some of which are:
        - Development (dev)
        - Quality Assurance (qa)
        - Staging (stage)
        - Production (prod)
    - There are multiple logging levels supported in Spring Boot:
    - Top-level logs all beneath it, for example 'debug' logs debug, info, warning, and error
    - Example: logging.level.org.springframework=debug
        1. trace: most detailed capturing almost all events (top-level)
        2. debug: detailed info on app flow
        3. info: general runtime info about app major events
        4. warning: potential issues or unexpected situation
        5. error: only errors and exceptions (bottom-level)
        6. off: turn off entire logging
