Get Production Ready with Spring Boot 
    - There are different types of environments some of which are:
        - Development (dev)
        - Quality Assurance (qa)
        - Staging (stage)
        - Production (prod)
    - There are multiple logging levels supported in Spring Boot:
    - Top-level logs all beneath it, for example 'debug' logs debug, info, warning, and error
    - Example: logging.level.org.springframework=debug
        1. trace: most detailed capturing almost all events (top-level)
        2. debug: detailed info on app flow
        3. info: general runtime info about app major events
        4. warning: potential issues or unexpected situation
        5. error: only errors and exceptions (bottom-level)
        6. off: turn off entire logging


Simplify Deployment with Spring Boot Embedded Servers
    - WAR Approach (OLD)
        - WAR
        - Web Server (Tomcat/Weblogic/WebSphere etc)
        - Java
    - Embedded Approach
        - JAR (Embedded Server - Tomcat...)
        - Java
    - How do you deploy your application? (WAR Approach) - Complex to setup
        1. Install Java
        2. Install Web/Application Server (Tomcat/Weblogic/WebSphere etc)
        3. Deploy the application WAR (Web ARchive)
    - Embedded Server - Simpler Alternative
        1. Install Java
        2. Run JAR file
    - Command for running JAR file in /target folder
        - java -jar [.jar file]
    - Make JAR not WAR (by Josh Long)
    - Embedded Server Examples:
        - spring-boot-starter-tomcat
        - spring-boot-starter-jetty
        - spring-boot-starter-undertow


Monitor Applications using Spring Boot Actuator
    - Monitor and manage your application in your production
    - Provides a number of endpoints:
        - /beans     - Complete list of Spring beans in your app
        - /health    - Application health information
        - /metrics   - Application metrics
        - /mappings  - Details around Request Mappings
    - Add this to the pom.xml:
        <dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
		</dependency>
    - To view actuator links:
        - http://localhost:8080/actuator
    - To view application health:
        - http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
    - To enable all actuator endpoints, head over to application.properties:
        - management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
    - To enable specific actuator endpoints, head over to application.properties:
        - management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,metrics


Understanding Spring Boot vs Spring MVC vs Spring
    - Spring Boot vs Spring MVC vs Spring: What's in it?
        1. Spring Framework: 
            - Dependency Injection
                - @Component, @Autowired, @ComponentScan, etc...
                - Just Dependency Injection is NOT sufficient (You need other frameworks to build apps)
                    - Spring Modules and Spring Project: Extend Spring Ecosystem
                        - Provide good integration with other frameworks (Hibernate/JPA, JUnit & Mockito for Unit Testing)
        2. Spring MVC (Spring Module): 
            - Simplify building web apps and REST API
                - Building web applications with Struts was very complex
                - With Spring MVC you can use @Controller, @RestController, @RequestMapping("/your_endpoint")
        3. Spring Boot (Spring Project):
            - Build PRODUCTION-READY apps QUICKLY
                - Starter Projects      - Make it easy to build variety of applications
                - Auto Configuration    - Eliminate configuration to setup Spring, Spring MVC, and other frameworks
                - Enable non-functional requirements (NFRs):
                    - Actuator          - Enables advanced monitoring of applications
                    - Embedded Server   - No need for separate application servers
                    - Logging and Error Handling
                    - Profiles and Configuration Properties
