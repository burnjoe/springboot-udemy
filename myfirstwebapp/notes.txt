Building Java Web Application
    - JSP means JavaServer Pages
    - All JSPs should be created in this specific directory (Standard)
        - /src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/WEB-INF/jsp/

How does Web work?
    - A: Browser sends a request
        - HttpRequest
    - B: Server handles the request
        - Your Spring Boot Web Application
    - C: Server returns the response
        - HttpResponse

Peek into History - Model 1 Arch.
    - ALL CODE in Views (JSPs, ...)
        - View Logic
        - Flow Logic
        - Queries to databases
    - Disadvantages:
        - VERY complex JSPs
        - ZERO separation of concerns
        - Difficult to maintain

Peek into History - Model 2 Arch.
    - How about separating concerns?
        - Model: Data to generate the view
        - View: Show information to client/user
        - Controller: Controls the flow
    - Advantages:
        - Simpler to maintain
    - Concerns:
        -Where to implement common features to all controllers (Solution: see Model 2 Architecture with Front Controller)
    - Model 2 Architecture with Front Controller
        - Concept: All requests flow into a central controller
            - Called as Front Controller
        - Front Controller controls flow to Controller's and View's
            - Common features can be implemented in the Front Controller

Spring MVC Front Controller - Dispatcher Servlet
    - A: Receives HTTP request
    - B: Processes HTTP request
        - B1: Identifies correct Controller method
            - Based on request URL
        - B2: Executes Controller method
            - Returns Model and View Name
        - B3: Identifies the correct view
            - Using View Resolver
        - B4: Executes View
    - C: Returns HTTP response
