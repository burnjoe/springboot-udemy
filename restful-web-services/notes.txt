Exploring Rest Controller
    - @Controller: marks a class as a controller
    - @RestController: marks a class as a REST controller (@Controller + @ResponseBody)
    - @RequestMapping: used to map HTTP requests to specific controller methods
        - @RequestMapping: maps all HTTP methods
        - @GetMapping: maps HTTP GET requests
        - @PostMapping: maps HTTP POST requests
        - @PutMapping: maps HTTP PUT requests
        - @DeleteMapping: maps HTTP DELETE requests
        - @PatchMapping: maps HTTP PATCH requests

What's happening in the background?
    - Spring Boot Magic: Enable Debug Logging
        - Warning: Log change frequently
    1. How are our requests handled?
        - DispatcherServlet: Front Controller Pattern
            - Mapping servlets: dispatcherServlet urls=[/]
            - Auto Configuration (DispatcherServletAutoConfiguration)
    2. How does HelloWorldBean object get converted to JSON?
        - @ResponseBody + JacksonHttpMessageConverters
            - Auto Configuration (JacksonHttpMessageConvertersConfiguration)
    3. Who is configuring error mapping?
        - Auto Configuration (ErrorMvcAutoConfiguration)
    4. How are all jars available (Spring, Spring MVC, Jackson, Tomcat)?
        - Starter Projects: Spring Boot Starter Web (spring-webmvc, spring-web, spring-boot-starter-tomcat, spring-boot-starter-json)

Naming Resources Standards & Methods
    - GET: /users           -> get all users
    - POST: /users          -> create a new user
    - GET: /users/{id}      -> get user by id
    - PUT: /users/{id}      -> update user by id
    - DELETE: /users/{id}   -> delete user by id
    - PATCH: /users/{id}    -> partial update user by id
    -------------------------------------------------------
    - GET: /users/{id}/posts            -> get all user's posts
    - POST: /users/{id}/posts           -> create a user's post
    - GET: /users/{id}/posts/{id}       -> get user's post by id
    - PUT: /users/{id}/posts/{id}       -> update user's post by id
    - DELETE: /users/{id}/posts/{id}    -> delete user's post by id
    - PATCH: /users/{id}/posts/{id}     -> partial update user's post by id

Resources with and without plurals
    - With Plurals (Commonly used due to readability and understandability):
        - /users/{id}/posts
    - Without Plurals:
        - /user/{id}/post
    - NOTE: It's not strictly necessary to use plurals as industries also uses without plurals, it's just a matter of preference (it's only just that it's common to use plurals)
