1. Maven Dependencies
    - Frameworks & libraries used in a project
    - Example: spring-boot-starter-web and spring-boot-starter-test
    - The reason why there are many dependencies in the classpath is due to Transitive Dependencies
    - Spring dependencies are not the same as Maven dependencies

2. Parent POM
    - Dependency Management: spring-boot-dependencies
    - Properties: java.version, plugins and configurations

3. Name of our Project (groupId + artifactId)
    - groupId: similar to package name
    - artifactId: similar to class name
    - These are important as it is how other projects can use this project as dependency
